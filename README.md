The document detailing the setup and configuration of software is found within the file named 'Question 1' in this repository. 
Challenges faced:
- I feel like the assignment was not clear enough on submission protocols.
- Some software e.g. MySQL had steps that are available only during the first installation and since during the assignment I had already installed previously, these steps were not available.
It was a great experience nontheless.
